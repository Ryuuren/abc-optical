            We sell ophthalmic glasses, sunglasses and contact lenses and we specialise in optical requirements for
            children. We are a Brisbane based company which is well regarded locally. We are recognised as being able to
            manage
            children's needs with a professional caring approach. We employ two full-time, in-store qualified
            optometrists able to diagnose and treat several eye related problems. Our optometrists strive to make a
            positive difference to the health and well-being of our customers, endeavouring to obtain the best visual
            outcome so that customers realise their full potential in work, study, sport and leisure.
